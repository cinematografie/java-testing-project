# Java Testing with Junit5
In this repo you will find some basic samples of Java code, alongside unit tests written in Junit5.

## About the repo
JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java.

We can use this tool to help us with test-driven development (TDD) and to improve test code coverage*.

Note: for coverage checking, depending on your team's goals, it is a good idea to follow the steps in "Running Tests" section and test with coverage. This will allow you to refactor with confidence. At the time of writing, the tests in this repo offer 100% line coverage on the code.


### Technical tools Used in this Repo

◦	Java JDK v11

◦	Junit v5.9.x

◦	Gradle v8.1.1

### Running Tests

◦ You can run tests within your IDE (I use IntelliJ) using the GUI/Runner, or you can run 
``./gradlew clean test``

◦ Gradle will give you an HTML report in build/reports which you can view in your browser
